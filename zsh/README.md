# zsh

This sets up zsh, aliases, functions, keybindings and autocompletions for various tools.

## Custom prompt

I'm using [starship.rs](https://starship.rs/) to provide a custom prompt with some additional information (current directory, git status) in zsh. If you don't intend to use it, you can remove the last line in my `.zshrc` that's initializing starship.
